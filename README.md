# battleship_environment

Just a fun learning project, wanted to try training a LLM. I chose Battleship because it seemed like a fun way to try out rlvr, and figuring out how to represent the grid-like board state to the llm seems like a fun challenge.

Checkout [verifiers](https://github.com/willccbb/verifiers) it's awesome!
