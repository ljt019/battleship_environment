# qwen3-battleship-grpo

Just a fun little learning project, I want to try fine-tuning my first LLM. RL (Reinforced Learning) is very popular right now, and Battleship seemed like a fun way to have verifible rewards and has the opportunity to teach me a lot about reward shaping for LMs and just about training in general.
